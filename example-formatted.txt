| Description    | Make fixed-width plaintext table with multi-line cell    |
|                | supports. Currently only support grid table, but it's    |
|                | trivial to adapt it to other layout once the table has   |
|                | been built. What plaintext table content is expected:    |
|                | <TAB> will be regarded as field delimiter, <LF> (or      |
|                | <CRLF> if on Windows) as row delimiter, and all the      |
|                | others as cell content.                                  |
+----------------+----------------------------------------------------------+
| FILE           | table content from which to read; if FILE is not         |
|                | specified, the table content will be expected from stdin |
